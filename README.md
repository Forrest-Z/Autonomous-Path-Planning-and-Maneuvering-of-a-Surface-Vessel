## launching
Contains launch and config files to run samples.

## guidance\_system
Code for guidance system for a stepwise maneuvering problem.

## motion\_control\_system
Code for control system for a stepwise maneuvering problem.

## navigation\_system
Code for navigation system for a stepwise maneuvering problem.

## transform\_mapping
Package for converiting Twist msg from observer to odom msg for creating map. gmapping pkg requires odom msg.

# ROS graphs
The figures shows the computation graph of the implemented GNMC system. The vertices in the graph represent ROS nodes, while the edges between them are ROS topics which the nodes communicate through. The graph is generated by the GUI plugin rqt_graph package. Nodes containing modbus in the name belongs to the OSP. The CME node is the Control Mode Executor, which is the superior node deciding in which control mode the vessel should be. The rest is self-explanatory.
